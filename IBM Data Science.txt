Tools for Data Science
Introduction to R and RStudio 
-statistical programming language 
-used for data processing and manipulation 
-statistical, data analysis and machine learning 
-R is used most by academics, healthcare and the government 
-easy to use compared to other Data Science tools
-Great tool for Visualization 

What is RSTudio
-Integrated Development Environment 
-Increases productivity in running R programming language
-Code Editor, Console, Workspace/History Tab, Plots, Files, Help, Packages
-dplyr, caret (machine learning)

Plotting within RStudio
R is a very great tool ofr visualization - some popular and top data visualizations are:
-ggplot - used for histograms, bar charts, scatterplots etc.
-plotly - an R package can be used to create web-based data visualization 
-lattice - data visualization tool that is used to imlement complex, multi-variable sets 
-leaflet - popular for creating interactive plots
